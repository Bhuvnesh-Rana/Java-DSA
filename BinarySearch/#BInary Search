Binary search is one of the searching techniques applied when the input is sorted here we are focusing on finding the middle element that acts
as a reference frame whether to go left or right to it as the elements are already sorted. This searching helps in optimizing the search 
technique with every iteration is referred to as binary search and readers do stress over it as it is indirectly applied in solving questions.

Binary Search Algorithm in Java

Below is the Algorithm designed for Binary Search:

        Start
        Take input array and Target
        Initialise start = 0 and end = (array size -1)
        Intialise mid variable
        mid = (start+end)/2
        if array[ mid ] == target then return mid
        if array[ mid ] < target then start = mid+1
        if array[ mid ] > target then end = mid-1
        if start<=end then goto step 5
        return -1 as Not element found
        Exit

        Methods for Java Binary Search

There are three methods in Java to implement Binary Search in Java are mentioned below:
        
    Iterative Method
    Recursive Method
    Inbuild Method



    Time complexity: O(log N)
    Auxiliary space: O(1)
