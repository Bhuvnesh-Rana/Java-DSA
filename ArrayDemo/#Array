Arrays

In Java, Array is a group of like-typed variables referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. 
Following are some important points about Java arrays. 

Arrays in Java
. In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated. (discussed below)
. Arrays may be stored in contiguous memory [consecutive memory locations].
. Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. This is different from C/C++, where we find 
length using sizeof.
. A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
. The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning with 0.
. Java array can also be used as a static field, a local variable, or a method parameter.

An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) and object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition of the array.
In the case of primitive data types, the actual values might be stored in contiguous memory locations(JVM does not guarantee this behavior). 
In the case of class objects, the actual objects are stored in a heap segment.
